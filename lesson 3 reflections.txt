When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  working from other computers, when your work space is constantly changing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  sometimes an update will break the existing code that you have worked on, although the
  implementation works on the master branch of the GitHub repository.
